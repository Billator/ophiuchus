Ophiuchus
=========

An implementation of the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) [MAZIERES]_.

``simple-scp``
--------------

A simple and network-less implementation of the SCP protocol on a single
slot.

Roadmap
-------

* implement and test ``simple-scp``
* implement and test ``scp-utils``, a real transport (probably based the noise
  framework or something similar). RPC vs gossip?
* implement and test ``ophiuchus``, a simple key-value store based on that stuff
